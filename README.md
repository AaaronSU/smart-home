## Application Interface

The application interface is an essential element of our smart home simulation project. This Android application allows users to visualize sensor data, control actuators, and configure their smart home settings, providing a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

### Key Features

- **Sensor Data Visualization**: The application displays real-time data collected by the smart home sensors. Users can monitor information such as temperature, humidity, brightness, etc.

- **Actuator Control**: Users can directly activate or deactivate actuators in the smart home, such as thermostats, lights, through the application. Users have complete control over the different devices in their home.

- **Real-time Notifications**: The application sends notifications to users in case of abnormal situations detected by the sensors, such as intrusion or water leakage. Users are immediately informed of these important events.

### User-Friendly Interface

The application interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, providing a pleasant user experience. Different sensors and actuators are presented as interactive cards, allowing users to navigate easily between different sections of the house.

Explicit icons and labels are used to facilitate understanding and navigation. Buttons and controls are logically arranged, enabling users to interact effortlessly with the various devices in their smart home.

The application is also compatible with a variety of Android devices, offering users flexibility in using their preferred smartphones.
